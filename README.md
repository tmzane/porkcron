# porkcron

Automatically renew SSL certificate for your Porkbun domain.

## ðŸ“Œ About

`porkcron` is a simple alternative to [certbot][1].
If you own a domain registered by [Porkbun][2], they offer you a [free SSL certificate][3] issued by [Let's Encrypt][4].
So instead of getting it from scratch yourself, you can periodically download the certificate using the [Porkbun API][5].
`porkcron` is designed to automate this process.
It can be run as a [systemd timer][6] or in a Docker container.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

First, you need to generate the API keys following [this guide][7].
Do not forget to enable the API access for your domain!

When you're ready, clone the repository somewhere on your server:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tmzane/porkcron
```

Take a look at the `.env.example` file.
It contains all the environment variables used by `porkcron`.
Rename it to `.env` and fill it with the values you got earlier.

| Name             | Description                         | Required | Default                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|:--------:|----------------------------------------|
| DOMAIN           | your Porkbun domain(s)              | yes      | -                                      |
| API_KEY          | your Porkbun API key                | yes      | -                                      |
| SECRET_KEY       | your Porkbun API secret key         | yes      | -                                      |
| API_URL          | the Porkbun API address             | no       | https://api.porkbun.com/api/json/v3    |
| CERTIFICATE_PATH | the path to save the certificate to | no       | /etc/porkcron/{domain}/certificate.pem |
| PRIVATE_KEY_PATH | the path to save the private key to | no       | /etc/porkcron/{domain}/private_key.pem |

Note the `{domain}` placeholder in the paths.
It will be automatically replaced with your domain.
You can use the placeholder in non-default paths as well.

`porkcron` can also work with multiple domains at once.
You can set `DOMAIN` to a comma-separated list of domains.
In this case, both `CERTIFICATE_PATH` and `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` must contain the `{domain}` placeholder.

Once you have filled in all the values, you can proceed to choosing the installation method.

### Using systemd

Run the following commands:

```shell
cd systemd
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This will install the script in `/usr/local/bin` and enable the timer.
The first run will be triggered immediately, check the log to make sure it was successful:

```shell
systemctl status porkcron.service
```

### Using Docker

Run the following commands:

```shell
cd docker
docker compose up
```

This will create the `porkcron` container and download the certificate bundle into the `ssl` volume.

### Changing the run schedule

By default, the script is run once per week,
which is plenty since the certificate is valid for 3 months.
You can change the schedule by modifying `systemd/porkcron.timer` (for systemd) or `docker/crontab` (for Docker).

### Configuring a web server

This repository contains an example for the [nginx][8] web server,
but you can use `porkcron` with the one of your choice.
See [Mozilla's SSL config generator][9] for a quick start.

For nginx, see `nginx/nginx.conf` for a minimal SSL-ready config.
You should modify it for your needs.

If you're using systemd, copy the modified config to `/etc/nginx/conf.d` and reload nginx.
Then uncomment the `ExecStartPost` line in `systemd/porkcron.service`.

If you're using Docker, just uncomment the `nginx` section in `docker/compose.yml`.

Finally, reinstall `porkcron` to apply the changes and try hitting `https://your.domain`.
The rest is up to you, happy hacking!
